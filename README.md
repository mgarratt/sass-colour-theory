Sass Colour Theory
==================

Taken information from [Basic color schemes: Color Theory Introduction]
(http://www.tigercolor.com/color-lab/color-theory/color-theory-intro.htm)
and created SASS functions to generate colours from the provided colour
schemes.

The idea is to be able to create a design using a single base colour and
these functions which can be re-skinned easily.
